### General Workflow

1. Run the jupyter notebook
   This script should do everything in one:
   - Apply inclusion and exclusion criteria
   - Determine ICU readmission rates
   - Generate Sankey plot
   - Output Table 1

   Expected outputs:
   - ICU Readmission Rate Table: A table detailing the readmission rates.
   - Sankey Plot: A diagram visualizing the flow of patient movement between different hospital units.
   - Table 1: A comprehensive breakdown of patient demographics, categorized by ICU readmission status (readmitted vs. not readmitted)
